## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This game of Tic Tac Toe has 3 primary classes the first being the Player class which represents the player mark. The GameBoard class contains all the logic regarding the game such as placing a marker, checking for a winner, and resetting the game. The UI class is in charge of displaying everything to the user.

## Optimizations:

I would like to create an AI so that the player can play against the computer because as of right now it's only playable with 2 people. I would also like to make that AI unbeatable by using the minimax algorithm.

## Lessons Learned:

This game was a great opportunity to work with arrays and create the logic that checks for the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of the array. I like that I was able to separate my code into different pieces which made it easier to read and modify.
